  <p id="text">Mubarak (Arabic: مبارك‎, romanized: mubārak) is an Arabic given name. A variant form is Baraka or Barack (Arabic: بارك‎, romanized: bārak), analogous to the Hebrew word "berech" ברךּ‎, meaning "knee", and derived from common Semitic roots for the concept of kneeling in praise/to receive a blessing.[1] Mubarak is thus the Arabic equivalent in meaning of the Latinate word "Benedict" (from Benedictus "blessed" or, literally, "well-spoken").

    Etymologically, the name is from the consonantal root B-R-K, meaning "knee", and verbally "to prostrate oneself", and hence "to receive blessing". The feminine noun barakah (بركة) means "blessing". In Islam, and specifically within the Sufi tradition, it has a meaning similar to "charisma". The Hebrew cognate is berakhah.[citation needed]
    
    The Biblical name Baruch is the Hebrew cognate; see Book of Baruch for an instance of the name.
    
    The name is sometimes written differently in different countries; for example, the last name of singer Shakira (a Lebanese-Colombian) is Mebarak.
    
    When an Arabic name is used in other languages, the patronymic is often rendered as a last name. In other contexts, Mubarak is a proper last name (e.g., cricket player Jehan Mubarak). </p>
